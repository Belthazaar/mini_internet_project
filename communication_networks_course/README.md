# Communication Networks course

In these folders, you can find our assignments that we used for the mini-Internet project at ETH Zurich since 2019. We also provide the configuration files that you can use the build the topology we describe in the assignment.

ℹ️ For the 2019 and 2020 iterations of the mini-Internet project we used pdf for the assignment whereas for the next iterations we used GitLab wiki instead.

ℹ️ For the 2019 iteration of the mini-Internet project, we used another implementation of the mini-Internet based on VMs instead of docker containers for virtualization. We include it only to show the topology and the questions we asked to our students. For anything else, it is preferable to look at the assignment starting from 2020.
