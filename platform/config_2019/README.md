#### Additional topologies

In this directory, we provide configuration files for different sizes of the mini-Internet.
If you want to quickly try the mini-Internet on a small server/VM, you may want to try the topologies with 1 or 2 ASes.
In the topology with 2 ASes, the two ASes are connected via the router TOKY, see `external_links_config_2.txt`.
If you want to try a larger mini-Internet, you may want to use the topology with 40 or 60 ASes.

We always use the same L2 and L3 topologies.
