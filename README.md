# An Open Platform to Teach How the Internet Practically Works

This is the official mini-Internet repository. For more information please see our [technical report]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02031.pdf).\
The documentation as well as the source code of the mini-Internet can be found in the [platform](platform) directory. \
In [2019_assignement_eth](2019_assignement_eth) we describe how we used the mini-Internet at ETH in the 2019 iteration of our [Communication Networks](https://comm-net.ethz.ch/) lecture.
